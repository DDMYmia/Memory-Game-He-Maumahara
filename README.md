# Memory Card Game — He Maumahara

He Maumahara is a brain-training memory card game inspired by everyday moments, whakataukī, and Māori design. It strengthens recall, supports te reo Māori, and brings playful cognitive training to Kaumātua and whānau.

## Overview

- Core gameplay: flip cards to find matching pairs under gentle time pressure.
- Levels: fixed-template beginner mode (Lv1), adjacency-driven challenge mode (Lv2), and image–word pairing (Lv3).
- Scoring: countdown timer with match-based rewards and streak bonuses.
- Data: local leaderboards and telemetry for engagement insights.

## Game concept and structure

He Maumahara (Memory Card) Game is described as being “based on traditional ‘match and recall’ formats” that require players to remember the locations and identities of cards and then retrieve matching pairs under time or task demands. The game increases in difficulty over time, “including the introduction of kupu (words)”, so that it moves from simple visual matching toward more complex language- and meaning-based memory challenges.

The visual content of the cards is culturally grounded. The document notes that Kaumātua at Rauawaawa have previously “been involved with our Māori design biscuit cutters” and that these unique Māori designs are patented and belong to Rauawaawa, which gives cultural and ethical safety to re-use these motifs in the game. This links the game directly to familiar imagery and to prior creative work that Kaumātua were part of, supporting engagement and a sense of ownership.

### Targeted cognitive processes

- Enhance working and episodic memory: Players hold card positions and images in mind, update after each turn, and retrieve them later — engaging short-term maintenance/manipulation and event-based recall.
- Promote visual recognition and pattern tracking: Matching pairs requires rapid visual discrimination and tracking patterns across space and time on the board.
- Stimulate frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes: Frontal supports attention control, strategic search, decision-making, and error monitoring; temporal supports memory encoding/retrieval and language when kupu are introduced; occipital drives visual processing and object recognition during scanning.
- Support cognitive resilience through playful engagement: Sustained attention, repeated recall, and incremental challenge help maintain or strengthen cognitive function in older adults.

### Evidence base and initial findings

In the evidence statement for this game, the document states that “studies show memory card games improve memory retention and can slow down cognitive decline when played consistently (Samonte et al., 2024; Mansoor & Katz, 2024).” These references indicate that:

- Memory-card-style interventions have been associated with improved memory performance in older adults.
- Regular, consistent play is important; benefits are linked to sustained engagement rather than one-off sessions.
- Such games are considered one component within a broader set of cognitive training approaches that can help slow trajectories of cognitive decline in ageing populations.

The note on Kaumātua involvement also serves as an initial finding about acceptability and cultural safety: incorporating patented Māori design imagery that belongs to Rauawaawa means the game is not only cognitively relevant but also culturally grounded and ethically appropriate for the Kaumātua who will use it.
