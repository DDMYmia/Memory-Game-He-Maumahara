Version: v4.0.0 (2026-01-21)

## Flow Index Refactoring
- **Simplified Fuzzy Rules**: Reduced from 16 rules → 8 rules → **6 rules**, removing all error rate and accuracy dependencies from base Flow Index calculation
- **Removed Accuracy from Rules**: Click accuracy removed from fuzzy rules to avoid double-penalization (errors already handled via error penalty mechanism)
- **Base Flow Index Range**: Adjusted to [0.7, 1.0] with 0.05 increments, ensuring minimum base score of 0.7
- **Rule Weights Updated**: R1 and R2 set to 1.0, R3 to 0.85, R4 to 0.80, R5 to 0.75, R6 to 0.70 (minimum)
- **New 6-Rule System**: Focuses purely on speed and cadence stability
- **Error Penalty Mechanism**: Changed to additive calculation (not multiplicative)
  - Base error penalty: 5% per failed match, maximum 30% (6 failed matches)
  - Consecutive error penalty: Starts from 3rd consecutive error, 3% per additional error, maximum 15% (8+ consecutive errors)
  - Combined error penalty: Additive (base + consecutive), maximum 45% total deduction
- **Cheat Penalty Mechanism**: Simplified to linear deduction
  - 3% per hint use, maximum 15% (5 uses)
  - Previous: Ratio-based with 50% maximum
- **Three-Layer Scoring**: Flow Index calculated as `baseFlowIndex × errorPenalty × cheatPenalty`
- **Improved Calculation Logic**: Base Flow Index focuses purely on speed and cadence stability (errors and accuracy handled separately via penalties)

Version: v1.4.2 (2025-12-10)

## Overview
- Enable AI engine on Level 3 page to provide adaptive difficulty suggestions.
- Fix potential lock when cards are flipped without `data-match` on Level 3.
- Standardize Level 3 start telemetry with variant payload (countdown, hide delay, show scale, total pairs).
- Clean up debug output and remove unnecessary `console.log`s.
- Minor consistency updates: replace loose equality with strict equality in timers.

## Detailed Changes
- Enable AI engine scripts
  - `lvl-3.html:65-68`: load `js/ai-engine.js` and `js/ai-helper.js` so `AIEngine` is available.
- Level 3 flip lock fix
  - `js/lvl3.js:200-208`: when any card lacks `data-match`, hide both cards, reset `flippedCards` and `lockBoard` instead of returning early.
- Level 3 start telemetry enhancement
  - `js/lvl3.js:167`: add `variant` with `pairsType`, `hideDelay`, `showScale`, `timerMode`, `initialTime`, `totalPairs`.
- Level 3 debug cleanup
  - Remove temporary debug logs in the match flow.
- Level 3 text/image normalization
  - `js/lvl3.js:331`: normalize by removing all spaces via regex for consistent matching.
- Level 1 improvements
  - `js/lvl1.js:77`: change `gameStart == 1` to `gameStart === 1`.
  - Remove a redundant debug print.
- Level 2 improvements
  - `js/lvl2.js:140`: change `gameStart == 1` to `gameStart === 1`.

## Behavior Changes
- Level 3: first flip telemetry includes complete variant info for better AI assessment and next-step suggestions.
- Level 3: UI no longer locks on malformed card data; flip state resets safely.
- Level 3: AI engine scripts are loaded; game end can produce cross-level config suggestions written to `localStorage`.

## Performance & Reliability
- Fewer lock risk paths on the flip interaction.
- Less debug noise in production, improving performance and privacy.

## Risks & Rollback
- Risk: strict equality may affect legacy logic if it depended on implicit type coercion.
- Rollback: revert the equality checks and removed logs if necessary.

## Verification
- Local preview `http://localhost:8010/lvl-3.html` and complete one round:
  - Check `start` telemetry includes `variant` fields.
  - Confirm `localStorage` writes `ai_level3_config`.
  - Simulate malformed card data (edit `dataset.match` in devtools) and verify no lock.
- Level 1/2: timer, flipping and scoring remain consistent.

## Follow-ups
- Extract common logic across Level 1/2/3 (timer, show/hide all, scoring) into shared modules.
- Add static checks (ESLint/Prettier) and enforce via CI.
- Consider preloading or lazy-loading images to improve first render.
